1. Join a voice channel
2. Make the bot join your channel by typing `/join`
3. Use `/start <target>` to select the target language and start the translation for yourself
4. Just talk like normal
5. Once you're done end your session using `/stop` and make the bot leave your channel using `/leave`

Other commands:
`/status` tells you if you have translation mode enabled.
`/languages` shows you all available languages.
